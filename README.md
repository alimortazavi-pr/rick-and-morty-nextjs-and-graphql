# Rick and Morty Characters Web Application

This is a simple web application built using Next.js, TypeScript, and Apollo Client to display characters from the "Rick and Morty" TV show using the GraphQL API provided by [Rick and Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/graphql). The application uses Server-Side Rendering (SSR) to fetch and display the characters.

   git clone https://github.com/alimortazavi-pr/rick-and-morty-nextjs-and-graphql.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   cd rick-and-morty-nextjs-and-graphql

3. Install the dependencies:
